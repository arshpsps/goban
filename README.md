### goban

> Simple kanban board app written in Go.

This app uses [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) for TUI. (bubbletea is sick (and annoying))

~Might wanna look into [cobra](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spf13/cobra)~

A cobra based approach wouldn't really work unless the app runs as a service or the like.
